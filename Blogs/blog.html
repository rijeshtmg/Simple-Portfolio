          <h1><u> How technology has affected us in our daily life</u></h1>
        </div>
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>
          In this blog, I'm going to discuss how technology has affected us in
          our everyday lives. Technology is transforming the world. Technology's
          greatest benefit is that it brings people together. Technology has a
          lot of advantages, but it also has a lot of drawbacks. We can do very
          complex tasks very easily with the aid of technology. It is fair to
          say that technology has made our lives much easier and more relaxed.
          Every day, the world advances and develops. Because of technological
          advancements, the world has become a completely different place. There
          are many aspects of our everyday lives in which we depend on various
          technology to complete our tasks.

          <h3>Type of Technology</h3>
          <p>
            There are many different type of technologies. The following are some important forms of technology:
            <ul>
              <li>Information Technology</li>
              <li>Communication Technology</li>
              <li>Medical Technology</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="defination">
          <p> Now we are going to describe how this type of technolgy are affecting in our day to day life.</p>
          <h4>Information Technology:</h4>
          <img src="/page/Blogs/image/information.png" alt="image">
          <div class="figname">Fig.2: Information Technology</div>
            <p> Information technology, referred as IT, is defined as the science and operation of storing and transmitting data using computers and other electronic devices.
            The use of computers and communications, as well as the transformation of data into information and knowledge, are all part of IT. From employee e-mail to database 
            management to e-commerce Web pages, most modern companies rely heavily on information systems. Hospitals
             must maintain massive patient records. Universities must manage extensive networks. An order-tracking system is needed even for a small, home-based cookie company. <br>
             In education the use of information technology has improved the efficiency and effectiveness of the educational process. It has improved the students' well-being. This process has been made simpler by established educational practices, such as the replacement of books with tablets and laptops. Furthermore, the development of e-learning platforms that enable students to learn from the comfort of their own homes. People who are out of school or who have trouble keeping up with their teachers in class may find these platforms to be an effective alternative.These platforms enable students to revisit courses at any time with clearer and more realistic explanations, which strengthens the educational process and leads to better school outcomes for the majority of students.
            </p>
            <h4>Communication Technology:</h4>
            <img src="/page/Blogs/image/communication.png" alt="image">
            <div class="figname">Fig.3: Communication Technology</div>
            <p>Thanks to new technology, the world is now regarded as a small village. The process of communication and information sharing has become so rapid that it has spread across the globe, affecting human life and bringing about fundamental change.Technology has an effect on how people interact, learn, and think. It contributes to society and influences how people communicate on a regular basis. In today's world, technology plays a critical role. It has both positive and negative effects on the environment, as well as a direct influence on people's lives. We live in a time when technological advancements are commonplace. Cell phones and the internet are two examples. However, there is a drawback to technical advancements. <br>
              Technology has impacted us through communication, how we talk and communicate with one another worldwide. Technology brought many new methods of electronic communication. For example, there are emails, social networking, the ability to facetime someone on the other side of the planet, and video conferencing, which allows you to have virtual meetings.These features also make communication more affordable than other methods, such as long-distance phone calls. Another advantage of information technologies is globalization.
              <br>Communication technology impacts people in a negative way when it comes to being sociable and having face-to-face contact. Mobile technology can decrease contact and relations between people. There is less personal time, and you may find that you do not have enough time for yourself because you are constantly in touch with others. It can also be a source of distraction from your studies. There is also a lack of privacy because everyone, at any moment, will find you everywhere. Finally, both of these factors have an effect on how people behave today. Our way of life will be simpler without technical advances. Today's human behavior is shaped by technological forces. </p>
              <h4>Medical Technology:</h4>
              <img src="/page/Blogs/image/medical.jpg" alt="image">
              <div class="figname">Fig.4: Medical Technology</div>
              <p>All scientific devices or equipment used to save human life is referred to as medical technology.
                There are over 500,000 technical devices and facilities in use in hospitals and other healthcare departments in the medical industry.
                Doctors could only predict illness until the invention of medical technology.That is the illness or issue that the patients are dealing with.
                In reality, diagnosing the exact conditions or diseases that people are suffering from is extremely difficult for doctors. However, with the advancements and inventions of medical technology, it has become much easier for them to identify the problem or illness and provide appropriate care to the patients.
                As a result, technology plays a critical role in medicine and healthcare.In the medical sector, technology has many advantages, but it also has drawbacks. <br>
                There are several devices available for patients to contact their doctors or nurses.
                These digital devices are designed for patients and are located in patient rooms or hospital wards.
                Patients should press the emergency button on these devices in the event of an emergency.
                It notifies the doctors or nurses of the patient's arrival time. There are many technological devices and facilities that have enhanced patient care or treatment.
                New medical devices such as the portable defibrillator, opioid delivery technology, MR system, and electronic IV monitors have enhanced patient care. The full health records of patients are usually kept on a computer in hospitals or with specialists.
                It is easier to keep records on a computerized system than it is to keep records on paper.
                When compared to paper documents, it takes less time. <br>
                One of the drawbacks of medical science is the increased cost of care.
                Almost all technological therapies and procedures, such as robotic surgery and other types of technological machinery surgeries, are extremely expensive.
                The majority of the patients come from rural areas and are sick.
                It is difficult for needy patients to afford expensive surgeries.
                Technology has improved health care, but it has also increased its expense.
                Patients are unable to compensate because of this. One of the disadvantages of medical technology is that the equipment or technological instruments will often produce incorrect results.
                It didn't always show the doctor the correct results of the patients.
                Engineers and programmers build technical devices.
                Errors and bugs can appear at any time.
                Then it stopped working properly.
                If it displays the incorrect result and the doctor diagnoses the patient incorrectly, the patient's life is jeopardized.
                For patients, this is one of the most dangerous aspects of medical science. The information about patients that is stored in the hospital's computer database may be a security breach.
                Computer networks can be hacked, allowing confidential information about a patient's condition to be obtained and modified.
                If anyone alters the patient's entire treatment history.
                As a result, it could pose a risk to the patient's subsequent treatments.
              </p>
              <p>As a conclusion i will like to conclude that the technology has both positive and negtive impact in our life. If we use the technology for the betterment of us it will be helpfull to us but if we dont use technology in right way it will be harmfull for us.</p>
